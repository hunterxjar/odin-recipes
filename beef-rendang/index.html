        <h3><p>What Kind of Beef for Rendang?</p></h3>
        <h5><p>I used boneless beef short ribs or stew beef. The cut of beef will ensure that you have soft and tender beef once it’s cooked.</p>
            <p>You have to cut the beef into small pieces to ensure that after the slow cooking, each chunk of beef is tender with the aromatic rendang curry paste.</p>
        </h5>
        <h3><p>Secret Ingredient of Rendang Sauce</p></h3>
        <h5><p>To make the best rendang, you need to have the secret ingredient which is <em>kerisik</em> or toasted coconut.</p>
            <p>You also need to cook on low heat to slowly stew and simmer the meat and reduce the rendang sauce.</p>
            <p>I read that the Minangkabaus save the dish for months as the complex taste and flavor develop over time.</p></h5>
